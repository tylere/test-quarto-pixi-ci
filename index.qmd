title: "Test Quarto Pixi CI w/ Multiple Environments"
---

This repository demonstrates how to create a [website](https://tylere.github.io/test-quarto-pixi-ci/) of coding tutorials.
- The website is static and is built by the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system.
- Website updates are triggered by GitHub Actions.
- Static files are hosted on GitHub pages.
- Each tutorial has a separate coding environment, allowing the use of different versions of libraries (or even different languages). Versioned libraries are defined by a configuration file within the tutorial folder ([example for tutorial 1](https://github.com/tylere/test-quarto-pixi-ci/blob/main/tutorials/tutorial_1/pyproject.toml), [example for tutorial 2](https://github.com/tylere/test-quarto-pixi-ci/blob/main/tutorials/tutorial_2/pyproject.toml)).
- To execute code within the tutorials, users can either:
  1. Download the notebook, and install dependencies in a local environment.
  2. Launch an online execution environment ([GitHub Codespace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/codespaces)) the configures the coding environment.
