    "text": "This repository demonstrates how to create a of coding tutorial website that (hopefully) reduces barriers to user contributions.\nKey characteristics:\n\nThe website is composed of static pages and is built by the Quarto publishing system.\nWebsite updates are triggered by a GitHub Action.\nStatic files are hosted on GitHub pages.\nEach tutorial has a independent coding environment, allowing the use of different versions of libraries (or even different languages). Versioned libraries are defined by a configuration file within the tutorial folder.\n\nExample for Tutorial 1 which uses Python 3.11 and has the xkcd Python package installed.\nExample for Tutorial 2 which uses Python 3.12 and has the shapely Python package installed.\n\nTo execute code within the tutorials, users can either:\n\nDownload the Jupyter notebook and install dependencies in a local environment.\nLaunch an online execution environment (GitHub Codespace) that includes a container configured for the tutorial (Container Configuration)"
